## 🖼 Interface Preview

### 🧟 Creature Editor

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/CreatureTab.png" width="95%" />
</p>

Build creatures the sane way.

The Creature Editor provides structured support for AzerothCore’s `creature_template` table with beginner-friendly field grouping, role presets, faction handling, and clear flag toggles.

The layout mirrors classic Trinity-style tools — but maps cleanly and directly to AzerothCore’s schema.

No guesswork. No mystery flags. No raw table hunting.

---

### 🧾 SQL Preview Generation

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/CreatureTabSQL.png" width="95%" />
</p>

Every change generates clean, readable SQL with transactional safety.

Preview it. Export it. Or push it straight to your database.

Because your tools should work with you — not against you.

### 🎒 Item Editor (Trinity-Style Layout)

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ItemTab.png" width="95%" />
</p>

The Item Editor follows a familiar Trinity-style layout with full AzerothCore alignment.

Toggle-based flags, class restrictions, race restrictions, and magic resistances make configuration intuitive — no bitmask math required.

Live tooltip preview ensures your item looks correct before it ever hits the database.

Design it. See it. Ship it.

---

### 🔎 Integrated Item Search

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/FindItem.png" width="70%" />
</p>

Quick lookup by name or ID keeps your workflow moving.

Cross-reference rewards, requirements, and dependencies without jumping between tools.

Less alt-tabbing. More building.

---

### 📜 Quest Editor with Live Preview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/QuestTab.png" width="95%" />
</p>

Structured support for `quest_template` with organized reward handling, requirement configuration, and a live quest preview panel.

Build complex quest chains without losing track of what connects to what.
